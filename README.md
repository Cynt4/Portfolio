**About me**
My name is Jacek Smoliniec. I am environmental engineer based in Katowice, Poland. Recently I've chosen a career journey to become a Software Tester. This career seems to be perfectly suited for my best capabilities. This portfolio is going to be the set of my skills and experiences that I've achieved in order to get a junior position in Software Testing.
